# University-Admissions-and-Shipping-Costs-Analysis
This project involves designing dashboards in Power BI to analyze trends in university admissions across the United States and to identify shipping cost leakages for a retail company. The project consists of three main problem statements:

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the trend of admissions into state universities in the USA and identify shipping cost leakages in a retail environment using Power BI. The project involves several key objectives:

1. **Data Transformations**: Preparing and transforming data using various techniques in Power BI's Query Editor.
2. **Advanced Visualizations**: Building custom visualizations to display insights into university admissions.
3. **Shipping Costs Analysis**: Analyzing shipping costs from both top-down and bottom-up perspectives.

## Problem Statements

### Problem Statement 1: Data Transformations

**Objective**: Perform data modeling and transformation using Query Editor.

- **Use Case**: Design a dashboard to analyze the trend of admissions into state universities.
- **Source**: USA State University Admissions data.

**Data Transformations**:

- Append Data
- Split Data
- Column Formatting
- Fill Columns
- Transpose Table
- Pivot / Unpivot
- Merge Join
- Conditional Columns
- Index Columns
- Summary Tables

### Problem Statement 2: Advanced Visualizations

**Objective**: Create advanced visualizations using expressions and filters.

- **Use Case**: Analyze university admissions trends and fund allocations.
- **Source**: USA State University Admissions data.

**Dashboards**:

1. Total Applications vs. Target Trend by State
2. Total Application by State Geo Dashboard
3. Tabular presentation of universities and funds
4. % of Applications by Race
5. Top 10 Universities by Applications
6. Top 10 Universities by Applications with and without Special Grants
7. Bottom 10 Universities by Applications
8. % of Applications Vs Universities Fund Allocations

### Problem Statement 3: Shipping Costs Analysis

**Objective**: Identify shipping cost leakages using top-down and bottom-up analysis.

- **Use Case**: Analyze shipping costs in a retail environment.
- **Source**: Superstore sales data.

**Top Down Analysis**:

1. Shipping Costs by Order Priority - Bar Chart
2. Shipping Costs by Shipping Mode - Funnel Chart
3. Shipping Costs by Customers - Scatter Plot
4. Transactional view of underlying data

**Bottom Up Analysis**:

1. Duplicate the above dashboard and modify interactions.
2. Replace the Transactional View with a Donut and Scatter Plot with a Tree Map.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- **Software**: Power BI Desktop
- **Data Sources**: Access to USA State University Admissions and Superstore sales data.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/university-admissions-shipping-analysis.git
    cd university-admissions-shipping-analysis
    ```

2. **Install required dependencies** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Open Power BI Desktop** and load the data sources provided in the repository.

## Using the Dashboards

1. **University Admissions Analysis**: 
   - Explore the visualizations for trends in university admissions, including state-wise applications, top and bottom universities, and fund allocations.

2. **Shipping Costs Analysis**: 
   - Utilize the dashboards to identify high-cost shipping areas, outliers in customer orders, and optimize shipping strategies.
